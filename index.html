      <p>During the summer, I like to read atleast five books. Some of the books I read are cook books. </br>I like to get inspiration about different foods from around the world.</br> I learn about different cultures and the spices they use in their food. </br>Also, I go to the beach and go swimming with my friends until the sun sets! What do you do during the summer?</p>
